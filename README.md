In this tutorial, you will create a to-do application. Your application will need to display the tasks, add new tasks, mark tasks as complete, and remove tasks. These actions will touch upon the four aspects of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) application.

This type of project is often accomplished with Class components, but this application will instead integrate React Hooks. React Hooks allow for functional components to have a state and use lifecycle methods, allowing you to avoid using Class components and have more modular and readable code.
